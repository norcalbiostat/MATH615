<span style="color:red">**Summary of schedule updates**</span>   

* MLR assignment has been re-drafted and cut down significantly
* Poster prep stage III will not have a peer review

### 11/19/18 - Fall Break. 
* Don't think about school, assignments or anything. 
* Please take some time to be among your family and practice self care in this incredibly stressful time. 


### 11/12/18 - Week 12 - Campus closed due to the Camp Fire
* Please check in with me on Slack or email to let me know you're OK (or if you're not OK. I want to know that too!)
* If you lived in the fire affected area please let me know. I want to support you in any way I can to finish the semester. Please check out campus resources: https://www.csuchico.edu/campfire/assistance.shtml 
* If you were not affected, please consider volunteering to help out those that have been, and/or helping raise funds through the Wildcats Rise Fire recovery fund https://app.mobilecause.com/vf/WildcatsRise 


### 11/6/18 - [Week 11](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk11.html)
* Tuesday: Writing and interpreting multivariable models
* Thursday: Moderation vs Confounding (bad lecture, too distracted)


### 10/30/18 - [Week 10](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk10.html)
* Tuesday: Moderation. What happens if we throw another variable into the mix? 
* Thursday: Study design. How to set yourself up for success in research. 


### 10/23/18 - [Week 9](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk09.html)
* Tuesday - Analysis of categorical data using $\chi^{2}$ tests
    - Additional lecture notes (lec03_cda) can be found on this topic under [Materials/Lecture notes](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/notes.html)
* Thursday - Correlation and Regression



### 10/16/17 - [Week 8](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk08.html)
* Comments on foundations assignment
    - CI and HT are statements about the population, not the sample
    - CI is a range of plausible values, need to compare interval to hypothesized value. 
    - Great resource for more learning: [Open Intro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php) Chapter 4 (free pdf)
    - Short worksheet for practice writing/conducting hypothesis tests. 
* Tuesday - comparing two means using a T-test for a difference in means
* Thursday - Analysis of Variance for comparing means across multiple groups
    - Lots of board work today
* Reading and reference material posted on schedule



### 10/9/18 - [Week 7](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk07.html)
* Midterm on Tuesday. Will emphasize correct identification of data, interpretation of univariate and bivariate graphics and use of summary statistics. 
* Lecture on choosing appropriate analyses on Thursday 
* A recap on hypothesis testing, the types of bivariate analysis we'll be conducting, and how to choose the correct analysis procedure for your research hypothesis. 
* Project updates: 
    - Introduction to Phase II of the project analysis preparation, 
    - Poster prep I instructions too vague to ensure quality work, going to roll points & grading into Stage II. 
    - I am in the process of commenting on everyones posters so far. 
* Instructions on Bivariate Inference Homework. 


### 10/1/18 - [Week 6](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk06.html)
* As we start our next phase of the class learning about _Inferential Statistics_, we need to first refresh our understanding about probability, distributions, confidence intervals.
* On thursday we'll walk through a hypothesis test using your research data. Check the schedule or weekly overview for how to prepare. (hint, you need some summary #'s from your data for this)


### 9/24/18 - [Week 5](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk05.html)
* Now that we've had a few weeks to settle into the semester, let's re-orient ourselves to the goals of this class. How are we achieving this goal?
* Housekeeping
    * Adding comments in a PDF in Google Drive. Comment directly in browser, don't open in GDocs. 
    * Some clarifying information about formulation of good RQ's and terminology has been added to the bottom of [HW02 research codebook](hw/02_research_codebook.html). 
    * I also added an example of C~C to [HW 06 Bivariate Graphing]
* Next big assignment is the Research plan. 
* Assigned reading: Difference between writing a research plan, and writing empirical research, how to conduct a literature review without getting burnt out, examples of how to use literature reviews to refine your RQ (citation assignment that is not assigned). 


### 9/17/18 - [Week 4](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk04.html)

* You will be exploring relationships between two variables using graphical and summary methods. 
* You will also start the work to build your research poster. See the [project instructions](project.html) page for details. 


### 9/11/18 - [Week 3](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk03.html)

I'll try to keep lecture this week to 30 min and let you have the rest of the time to work. 


**Visualizing Data!**

* One of the most important things you can do to learn about your variables is to create descriptive plots. 
* We spent time last week talking about how to choose appropriate visualizations and how to interpret them. You were then supposed to go create those plots on your own. 
    - Then I found out that SPSS doesn't let you use the chart builder on un-prepared data. 
* So the due date for the Univariate graphing assignment has been pushed back to next Monday 9/17.

**Preparing your data for analysis.**

We'll talk about how to identify features of data that will need to be changed prior to analysis. We can't cover them all, nor would you remember them all. This is a place where experience and repetition will be the true learning method. In the meantime, I provide a number of resources to help you identify what to look for. 

* AS notebook chapter 1
* Data management preparation questions
* PMAS6 Draft Chapter 3.4
* PMAS5 Chapter 4 (transformations)

### 09-02-2019: Week 2

Hope everyone had a relaxing 3day weekend. Office hours have been set. Thank you for contributing! 

* Mon 3-4pm  
* Wed 1-2pm  
* Thu 10-11am  

We've seen some pitfalls regarding data entry, and practiced reading in data into our SPC. 
**SPSS users need to add information to the [collaborative SPSS notes](https://hackmd.io/00_J78IaQouu4DalQ-3P3w) on how to read data into SPSS**

Next up is setting up a reproducible research pipeline, choosing some research hypotheses and then we'll start talking about how to describe distributions of a single variable using summary statistics, tables and plots. We're going to do this on the "dirty" data because visualization is a really good way to detect any problems in the data.
