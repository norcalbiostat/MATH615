    - Short worksheet for practice writing/conducting hypothesis tests.

* On thursday we'll walk through a hypothesis test using your research data. Check the schedule or weekly overview for how to prepare. (hint, you need some summary #'s from your data for this)


### 9/24/18 - [Week 5](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk05.html)
* Now that we've had a few weeks to settle into the semester, let's re-orient ourselves to the goals of this class. How are we achieving this goal?
* Housekeeping
    * Adding comments in a PDF in Google Drive. Comment directly in browser, don't open in GDocs. 
    * Some clarifying information about formulation of good RQ's and terminology has been added to the bottom of [HW02 research codebook](hw/02_research_codebook.html). 
    * I also added an example of C~C to [HW 06 Bivariate Graphing]
* Next big assignment is the Research plan. 
* Assigned reading: Difference between writing a research plan, and writing empirical research, how to conduct a literature review without getting burnt out, examples of how to use literature reviews to refine your RQ (citation assignment that is not assigned). 


### 9/17/18 - [Week 4](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk04.html)

* You will be exploring relationships between two variables using graphical and summary methods. 
* You will also start the work to build your research poster. See the [project instructions](project.html) page for details. 


### 9/11/18 - [Week 3](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk/wk03.html)

I'll try to keep lecture this week to 30 min and let you have the rest of the time to work. 


**Visualizing Data!**

* One of the most important things you can do to learn about your variables is to create descriptive plots. 
* We spent time last week talking about how to choose appropriate visualizations and how to interpret them. You were then supposed to go create those plots on your own. 
    - Then I found out that SPSS doesn't let you use the chart builder on un-prepared data. 
* So the due date for the Univariate graphing assignment has been pushed back to next Monday 9/17.

**Preparing your data for analysis.**

We'll talk about how to identify features of data that will need to be changed prior to analysis. We can't cover them all, nor would you remember them all. This is a place where experience and repetition will be the true learning method. In the meantime, I provide a number of resources to help you identify what to look for. 

* AS notebook chapter 1
* Data management preparation questions
* PMAS6 Draft Chapter 3.4
* PMAS5 Chapter 4 (transformations)

### `r format(wk1.date+7, "%m-%d-%Y")`: Week 2

Hope everyone had a relaxing 3day weekend. Office hours have been set. Thank you for contributing! 

* Mon 3-4pm  
* Wed 1-2pm  
* Thu 10-11am  

We've seen some pitfalls regarding data entry, and practiced reading in data into our SPC. 
**SPSS users need to add information to the [collaborative SPSS notes](https://hackmd.io/00_J78IaQouu4DalQ-3P3w) on how to read data into SPSS**

Next up is setting up a reproducible research pipeline, choosing some research hypotheses and then we'll start talking about how to describe distributions of a single variable using summary statistics, tables and plots. We're going to do this on the "dirty" data because visualization is a really good way to detect any problems in the data.
