### 10/1/17 - [Week 7](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk07.html)
* As we start our next phase of the class learning about _Inferential Statistics_, we need to first refresh our understanding about probability. 
    - Week 7 overview has been posted and includes reading material and learning videos. 
* An optional Exam error assessment has been posted to [Week 6](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk06.html#thursday:_exam_1)

* Lecture on choosing appropriate analyses on Tuesday. 
* Introduction to the next phase of the project analysis preparation. 
* Midterm on Thursday. Will emphasize correct identification of data, interpretation of univariate and bivariate graphics and use of summary statistics. [[Sample Exam]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/docs/Sample_Exam_1.pdf)
* Bivariate graphing assignment - also upload to BBLearn. Makes it easier for me to grade and comment on. 
    - My comments are going on your blog posts. 

### 9/18/17 - [Week 5](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/wk05.html)
* You will be exploring relationships between two variables using graphical and summary methods. 
* Tuesday we will talk about grouped summary statistics and how to interpret bivariate graphics. 
* Thursday I am out of town, so it will be an open work day. 


### 9/11/17 - Week 4
* You will read about the difference between writing a research plan, and writing empirical research. 
* Most of this week will be open work time on graphing and writing your research plan. 


### 9/3/17 - Week 3

* Visualizing Data!
    - One of the most important things you can do to learn about your variables is to create descriptive plots. 
    - We're going to spend in class time making sure you know how to choose appropriate visualizations and how to read them
    - You will spend outside class time _creating_ these plots. 
* Blogging
    - Don't forget to review your assigned classmates blog posts. You can check the [Peer Review Rotation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1njtZX4tv_3G7OgbJA5KFyHF3ecU4KPV7qdnGxSGMbVA/edit?usp=sharing) Google spreadsheet to see your assignments. 
    - To help see overlap and for me to help all of us connect variables to RQ's I have added a **Research Topics** tab to the above spreadsheet. 
        - Look this over so you are aware of what content is stored in here. This helps both you and me make sure you are using the correct variables for your RQ's. 
        - It would help all of us if you could keep your entry up to date as you refine your RQ and list of associated variables. 
* Constructed measurements
    - For those of you analyzing psychosocial measurements such as depression or anxiety, certain AddHealth variables were asked as _scales_ - or a series of questions that must be combined in a specific manner that has been validated. 
    - You need to find out how these measurements should be constructed, or at least how other resarchers have used these variables to construct (say) a measure of depression. 
    - This could be found by looking at the Add Health documentation (from the website), or during your literature review you will come across other research that has used these measures.
    - Many of you are using similar measures, I suggest getting together and splitting up the work (i.e. 1-2 people look for depression, others look for health/fitness measures etc)

### 9/04/18 - Week 2 (short week)

Hope everyone had a relaxing 3day weekend. Office hours have been set. Thank you for contributing! 

* Mon 3-4pm  
* Wed 1-2pm  
* Thu 10-11am  

Appointments outside these hours can be made by using the appointment booking icon at the bottom of my personal website (link in the top right of this webpage). _Unfortunately_ i'm in/out of town this week at a conference in Sacramento. I won't be able to make any of my OH this week. 

We've seen some pitfalls regarding data entry, and practiced reading in data into our SPC. 
**SPSS users need to add information to the [collaborative SPSS notes](https://hackmd.io/00_J78IaQouu4DalQ-3P3w) on how to read data into SPSS**

Next up is setting up a reproducible research pipeline, choosing some research hypotheses and then we'll start talking about how to describe distributions of a single variable using summary statistics, tables and plots. We're going to do this on the "dirty" data because visualization is a really good way to detect any problems in the data.
