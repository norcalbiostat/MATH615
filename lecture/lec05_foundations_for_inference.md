# Lec05 - Foundations for Inference


By the end of this topic students will be able to 

* Identify and distinguish between a parameter and a statistic
* calculate a simple probability of exploding. 
* describe how to generate a sampling distribution using simulation
* explain the difference between a probability distribution and a sampling distribution.
* describe the concept of sampling variability.
* how to calculate the mean and sd of the sampling distribution based on population parameters
* Explain what the Central Limit Theorem says

# Overview

Companies such as Pew Research frequently conduct polls as a way to understand the state of public opinion or knowledge on many topics, including politics, scientific understanding, brand recognition, and more. The ultimate goal in taking a poll is generally to use the responses to estimate the opinion or knowledge of the broader population.

Over the next two weeks we will learn how to talk about samples and populations, and how to use probabilty to quantify how likely it is for something to occur.

## Collaborative Lecture

In groups, review your assigned section in either the the [[OpenIntro Statistics textbook]](https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics) or Dr. D's [[Math 315 course notes]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/reading/RAD_course_notes_f19.pdf). 

With a partner, write a summary of your section below. Be prepared to instruct the class on your assigned portion. 

* **Parameters and Statistics** (Dr. D's notes, section 4.1)



* **Point Esimates** (Dr. D's notes, section 4.2, Open Intro pg 170)



### Definitions

With a partner, come up with an agreed upon definition, and an example, of the following. You can use google and/or either of the text references above. 

* **population**


* **sample**


* **bias**

## Parameters vs Statistics (think-pair-share)

For each question mark TRUE or FALSE, and write a justification for your answer 

1. In a study of all 2857 employees at a college, it is found that 45% own a vehicle.  
**TRUE OR FALSE**: The number 45% is a parameter. 


2. Suppose you want to estimate the percentage of videos on YouTube that are cat videos. It is impossible for you to watch all videos on YouTube so you use a random video picker to select 1000 videos for you. You find that 2% of these videos are cat videos.   
**TRUE OR FALSE**: A video in your sample is a sample statistic. 


3. Same cat video setup as above.   
**TRUE OR FALSE**: 2% is a sample statistic.

## Probability of Exploding

In class Dr. D handed out ___ Exploding kitten cards. 

:question: How many were cards that make you go *boom*? 

:question: What's the probability of going *boom*? 

:question: How many _Imploding Kitten_ card were there? 

:question: What's the probability of imploding? 

:question: _Given that you went *boom*, what's the probability that you imploded instead of exploded?

## Simulating sampling distributions
In class activity. Instructions at Discovering Sampling Distributions [[HTML]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/hw/activity_samp_dist.html)[[PDF]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/hw/activity_samp_dist.pdf)

#### Describe the distribution of the x's

* `2d10`:

* `4d10`:

* `3d4`: 



#### Describe the distribution of the x-bars? 

* `2d10`:

* `4d10`:

* `3d4`: 




1. explain the difference between a probability distribution and a sampling distribution.


2. Describe the concept of sampling variability.


3. As the sample size increases, describe what happens to the following features of the sampling distribution
      - mean:
      - standard deviation: 
      - shape
      
      
4. As the number of samples increases, describe what happens to the following of the sampling distribution
      - mean:
      - standard deviation: 
      - shape
