:question: **How do you plan on implementing a reproducible workflow for your analysis in this class?**




## Data Management specific questions. Put your name next to your answer 

:question: **Now that you've chosen a data set and looked at the codebook, what types of data management tasks do you anticipate having to do with your data?**





:question: **Give one specific example of a change you will have to make to your data.**
        - **A**: How did you detect something was wrong?
