# Lec03 - Preparing data for analysis


By the end of this topic students will understand 

* what a reproducible workflow looks like
* options for literate programming
* several questions to ask themselves when preparing data for analysis

The bulk of the lecture notes for this topic can be found in the Applied Stats notebook
https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/data-management.html

This document will serve as a place for us to brainstorm and share our thoughts.

## Think-pair-share

:question: **What does it mean for an analysis to be reproducible?**

- To create a accurate record of steps taken and what code/program was used to achieve reproducibility
- 
- Can get the same results when using the same code/analysis on the same data; can get a similar result structure when using different data but same method.
- The same results are achieved by different people running the same analyses 
- Everyone will get the same results because all the steps are included in the code
- has a codebook where variables are defined and expected result values are given for each variable

- clear, reliable and systematic, universal methods
- anyone who has access to the  dataset can perform the  analysis with same results



:question: **How do you plan on implementing a reproducible workflow for your analysis in this class?**

- I will use R code to create a methodology one step at a time, troubleshooting each step before moving on. At the end I should have a versatile workflow that can handle my data given I have de-bugged various problems. I will include literate programming text for my sake! as well as others hoping to use the code. Maybe document problems I faced in the text.

- Creating a specific step by step process including explanations, interpatations and code for software  
- Make sure that I can understand my own notes. 
 
 - Keep thorough notes- on process, data changes, errors, 
- plain english sentence talking about what I plan to do -> the code necessary to complete that goal -> the output -> plain english sentence talking about what happened

- Update consistently 
- Ask for HELP
- Summarize in english what I'm doing, then write the code and so on, keeping everything in one script. 

- Have notes to understand the reproducible workflow analysis, especially on the parts I do not feel comfortable with. 
- Create step by step instructions for each step of analysis written out, i.e. google doc or word doc, update and refine when necessary, make it readable not just to myself but to anyone who reads the document so they can repeat same steps

I'm going to have to find the most efficient path for myself as I go along. Keeping good notes on each step by step processes, screen shots and explainations of tools within R so I can remember how to do things will help.

## Data Management specific questions. Put your name next to your answer 

:question: **Now that you've chosen a data set and looked at the codebook, what types of data management tasks do you anticipate having to do with your data?**





:question: **Give one specific example of a change you will have to make to your data.**
        - **A**: How did you detect something was wrong?    
        - **B**: What exactly needs to be changed? 
        - **C**: how exactly (code or menu button) are you going to implement the change?
