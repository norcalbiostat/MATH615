# Lec04 - Describing distributions and relationships


By the end of this topic students will understand 

* how to describe a single distribution
* how to describe the relationship between two variables
* what types of plots or visualizations are appropriate for different data types and combinations of variables
* what types of numerical summary statistics are appropriate for different data types and combinations of variables
* what discussion points are needed to be included in a complete description. 

The details on what the plots look like and how to create them can be found in the Applied Stats notebook

# Class contributed recap. 
For each section below, write instructions and guidance on how to fully describe and visualize the topic. Write your responses as if you were writing instructions to an undergraduate student. 

## Describing data (Table 1)
To describe the distribution of data you must include three things: 

1. Explain what we're looking for in complete English sentence

2. Graph the data

3. Descriptive sentence to conclude your findings: talk about summary statistics


## Single Categorical Measure (Table 2)


- Bar chart to visualize data
- Identify what type of categorical variable it is (nominal, binary, ordinal)
- Write descriptive paragraph to describe the distribution
- Calculate summary statitcs: % most frequent, % least frequent, counts

## Single Quantitative Measure (Table 3)
1. Has to do with numbers  
2. Quantitative measures inclide:
box plots, histogram, density plot, and want to see  location, shape,  skewness, peaks, range of data, IQR
(ANYTHING BUT BAR CHARTS and PIE CHARTS!)
3. Include summary statistics- standard deviation, median, min, max, & outliers 
4. Discuss: shape, spread, location



## Explanatory vs Response measures (Table 4)
Define/Describe, and provide an example of each.

**Explanatory**
1. Explanatory is the independent variable.
E variable: characteristics of outcome variables or predictors to an outcome: demographic background, socioeconomics. Ex: Do you smoke cigarettes? Yes/No

**Response**
3. Response measures outcome AKA dependent variable. ex: LUNG CANCER.

## Categorical explanatory vs. Categorical response (C~C)

* graph: Side by side barcharts
* N, %'s of response within each level of explanatory varible


## Categorical explanatory vs. Quantitative response (Q~C)

* graph: boxplots, density plots, histograms - for every level of the categorical explanatory variable. 
* same summary statistics: mean, sd, 
* talk about shape, center, spread for each category. Using comparative language
* 



## Quantitative explanatory vs. Quantitative response (Q~Q)

Explain: 
* **direction**: pos or neg
* **form**: linear vs nonlinear
* **strength**: -1 (perfect neg corrre), 1 (perfect pos corre) 

Plot: scatterplot

Summary stats: correlation
